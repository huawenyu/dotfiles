# Q: Why does Cygwin execute shell commands very slowly?
#     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6811435/why-does-cygwin-execute-shell-commands-very-slowly

# A: Below are 3 possible causes which I encountered. Of course, other problems not mentioned can also cause slow shell commands in Cygwin.
#
# If you have the option "Automatically detect settings" in "LAN Settings", Windows will use the WPAD protocol to discover the local HTTP proxy. First it will send a DHCP "Inform"
# 	request with option 252, then it will try a DNS lookup on "wpad". These 2 operations can take a few seconds to time-out.
#
# 	If the shell accesses some paths like /cygdrive/... , a NetBIOS name query will be executed, which can also take some time to time out.
# 	If the shell accesses some paths like /drives/... , a NetBIOS name query will be executed, which can also take some time to time out.
# 	If the shell accesses some paths like //mypath/... , a NetBIOS name query will be executed, which can also take some time to time out.
#
# 	Solutions :
#
# 	1. Disable "Automatically detect settings" in "LAN Settings" in the Windows "Internet Options" control panel.
#
# 	2. Add the following entry in %SystemRoot%\system32\drivers\etc\hosts :
#
# 	127.0.0.1 localhost cygdrive drives wpad
#
# 	3. Make sure to avoid double slashes at the beginning of all paths.
